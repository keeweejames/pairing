Python - commonly used in social apps, financials, and AI
        - easy to pick up, in high demand
Javascript - highest use in customer facing "interactive" website
            -can be coded in browser-based software 'node.js'
            -use to design pop-up ads >:(
Java - used to connect "client-server" functions, can be run on several coding platforms that support interactive
        - ideal for big businesses with large server-based needs
        - not well suited for cloud-based operations 
C# - developed by Microsoft, functions primarily for windows app developments and ads
    - can be difficult to learn
    - operable on mobile and gaming platforms with additional extention
C - commonly used for programming hardware, early developed language (foundational)
   - more complex than most contemporary languages
   - not well suited mobile or web bases applications
C++ - extention of C, is similarly can be used as a foundation for most applications
     - equally complex to can
     - works well for "multi-platform systems" (those that are access via web, mobile, console, etc.)
Go - Developed by Google, not commonly used in development world at this point
    - does not have "library for graphical user interfaces", ie. it can't be used for most commen end-user interactions
    - well suited for processing large quantities of data from multiple networks (think silicon valley big businesses)
R - High demend in 'machine learning' and statistical analysis applications
   - not well established in structure or libraries compared to older languages
   - has space to be expanded or altered to increase function (extensible)
Swift - Develped by Apple, used in all mobile and computing OS (newer than iOS7)
        - easy to read and efficient
        - exclusive to Apple products
PHP - Has been developed significantly due its early development and common use
      - Known security issues
      - works well for "content-oriented" applications that frequently communicate with servers for information
